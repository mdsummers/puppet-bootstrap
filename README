Standalone Puppet manifest to bootstrap a passenger-based puppetmaster on RHEL
and equivalents. Currently assumes puppetmaster has never been installed and
the puppetmaster is to be referred to as puppet.$domain.

Given that EPEL is a requirement to yum install puppet, deal with that outside
bootstrap script. For el6:
# wget http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
# rpm -Uvh epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm

$ git clone git://github.com/bodgit/puppet-bootstrap.git
$ puppet --modulepath . -e 'include puppet-bootstrap'
